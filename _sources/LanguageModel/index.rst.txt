SystemVerilog Language Model
############################

.. topic:: Design Goals

   * Clearly named classes that model the semantics of System Verilog.
   * All language constructs (statements, declarations, specifications, â€¦) have their own classes.
     |br|
     These classes are arranged in a logical hierarchy, with a single common base-class.
   * Child objects shall have a reference to their parent.
   * Comments will be associated with a particular code object.
   * Easy modifications of the object tree.
